@article{KremerMarkowitchZhou2002,
  Abstract =	 {With the phenomenal growth of the Internet and open
                  networks in general, security services, such as
                  non-repudiation, become crucial to many
                  applications.  Non-repudiation services must ensure
                  that when Alice sends some information to Bob over a
                  network, neither Alice nor Bob can deny having
                  participated in a part or the whole of this
                  communication. Therefore a non-repudiation protocol
                  has to generate non-repudiation of origin evidences
                  intended to Bob, and non-repudiation of receipt
                  evidences destined to Alice. In this paper, we
                  clearly define the properties a non-repudiation
                  protocol must respect, and give a survey of the most
                  important non-repudiation protocols. We describe
                  protocols without and with trusted third party
                  (TTP). For the later ones we discuss the evolution
                  of the TTP's involvement and, between others,
                  describe the most recent protocol using a
                  transparent TTP. We also discuss some ad-hoc
                  problems related to the management of
                  non-repudiation evidences and shortly overview
                  several efforts to formally verify these protocols.},

@inproceedings{KremerRaskin2002,
  abstract =	 {In this paper we report on the verification of two
                  contract signing protocols. Our verification method
                  is based on the idea of modeling those protocols as
                  games, and reasoning about their properties as
                  strategies for players. We use the formal model of
                  alternating transition systems to represent the
                  protocols and alternating-time temporal logic to
                  specify properties. The paper focuses on the
                  verification of abuse-freeness, relates this
                  property to the balance property, previously studied
                  using two other formalisms, shows some ambugities in
                  the definition of abuse-freeness and proposes a new,
                  stronger definition. Formal methods are not only

  abstract =	 {In this paper, we report on a recent work for the
                  verification of non-repudiation protocols. We
                  propose a verification method based on the idea that
                  non-repudiation protocols are best modeled as games.
                  To formalize this idea, we use alternating
                  transition systems, a game based model, to model
                  protocols and alternating temporal logic, a game
                  based logic, to express requirements that the
                  protocols must ensure.  This method is automated by
                  using the model-checker {\scshape Mocha}, a
                  model-checker that supports the alternating
                  transition systems and the alternating temporal
                  logic. Several optimistic protocols are analyzed
                  using {\scshape Mocha}.},

                  objectives which is within the scope of standard
                  security analysis methods, as it does not require
                  fairness constraints and uses only standard
                  authentication and secrecy properties. We also
                  analyse this model for finitely and infinitely many

abstract = {In this paper, we provide the first methodology for reasoning about liveness properties of cryptographic protocols in a machine-assisted manner without imposing any artificial, finite bounds on the protocols and execution models. To this end, we design an extension of the SAPiC process calculus so that it supports key concepts for stating and reasoning about liveness properties, along with a corresponding translation into the formalism of multiset rewriting that the state-of-the-art theorem prover Tamarin relies upon. We prove that this translation is sound and complete and can thereby automatically generate sound Tamarin specifications and automate the protocol analysis. Second, we applied our methodology to two widely investigated fair exchange protocols -- ASW and GJM -- and to the Secure Conversation Protocol standard for industrial control systems, deployed by major players such as Siemens, SAP and ABB. For the fair exchange protocols, we not only re-discovered known attacks, but also uncovered novel attacks that previous analyses based on finite models and restricted number of sessions did not detect. We suggest fixed versions of these protocols for which we prove both fairness and timeliness, yielding the first automated proofs for fair exchange protocols that rely on a general model without restricting the number of sessions and message size. For the Secure Conversation Protocol, we prove several strong security properties that are vital for the safety of industrial systems, in particular that all messages (e.g., commands) are eventually delivered in order.},

abstract = {  Security APIs, key servers and protocols that need to keep the
  status of transactions, require to maintain a global, non-monotonic
  state, e.g., in the form of a database or register. However, most
  existing automated verification tools do not support the analysis of
  such stateful security protocols -- sometimes because of fundamental
  reasons, such as the encoding of the protocol as Horn clauses, which
  are inherently monotonic.  A notable exception is the recent tamarin
  prover which allows specifying protocols as multiset rewrite (msr)
  rules, a formalism expressive enough to encode state. As multiset
  rewriting is a ``low-level\'\' specification language with no direct
  support for concurrent message passing, encoding protocols correctly
  is a difficult and error-prone process.

  We propose a process calculus which is a variant of the applied pi
  calculus with constructs for manipulation of a global state by
  processes running in parallel. We show that this language can be
  translated to msr rules whilst preserving all security properties
  expressible in a dedicated first-order logic for security
  properties. The translation has been implemented in a prototype tool
  which uses the tamarin prover as a backend. We apply the tool to
  several case studies among which a simplified fragment of PKCS\\#11,
  the Yubikey security token, and an optimistic contract signing
  protocol.},
